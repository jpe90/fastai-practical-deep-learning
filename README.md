python scripts from fastai's [practical deep learning for coders](https://course.fast.ai/) without jupyter notebooks

i would recommend you install dependencies in a venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastai
pip install duckduckgo_search
```

tested on macOS and linux, does not work on windows without WSL
